I recently started playing the game a bit and noticed the "00 Performance" fork of "This mod could save you 30% or more on lag insurance" mod. Didn't want to install other dependencies for "OO Performance". Since I've got a framework in place I decided to make a plugin for the mod. Installing the base mod should be straightforward enough:
1. Install DMM
2. Install any compatibility patches you might need
3. Install existing plugin patches that you want

Ensure that it is located at the bottom of the list.

[h1]For which version of the game is this?[/h1]
2.5
